The purpose of this repository is to build upon the fundamentals of website development.I was able to use tools like Javascript, Plotly, and D3.json to implement multiple graphs about which bacteria species are able to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. I learned to learn multiple ways to extract data and see how something like this could be applicable to other fields. This is also the first repository implemented that was uploaded to a website, where I learned how to connect and display it on my personal website.
